				<p>I have loved technology since my first memories as a child, I used to take everything apart just to see how they work, apart from that I love my country/helping and volunteering this is why I served 8 years in the US ARMY.
					I chose not to re-enlist because I have a family now, and I did not want my family to move around every few years. Every action I take has my family in mind. This is why I am going to take my love/passion for technology and not just see how it works, but CREATE IT!</p>
